# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

This assignment was created in its entiriety in Javascript D3.

The information was retrieved in the form of a Json file so iteration through the data was necesary to be made while also every function that ran each plot needed to be called. This process happens every time the app is being launched so a smooth iteration and calling of every variable needed was essential to make every plot work.
